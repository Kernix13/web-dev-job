## CRUD Ideas

- `A CRUD web application`: A basic form of a CRUD application is a To-Do List or a Notes webpage. Having one of these projects on your website shows your skill with manipulating data structures. It's also a good opportunity to display your work with a frontend framework - Tania Rascia's article on working with local storage is a helpful introduction to learning how to create CRUD web applications with vanilla JavaScript: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-local-storage-with-javascript/ | https://www.taniarascia.com/crud-app-in-react-with-hooks/ | it's a good idea to build them using a framework such as React

1. [5 Coding Projects You Should Include in Your Front End Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/coding-projects-to-include-in-your-frontend-portfolio/)

A portfolio is especially helpful for entry-level developers who might not have any professional work experience. But what do you include in it?

Is the simple web page you built for a course good enough to put on your website? Do you have to only include projects you were paid for, or can you include even the smallest of things? Is there a 'right' number of projects to have?

> Their list of project ideas are included in the lists above...here are some good notes:

### Your portfolio site as a project

- So long as you've built your portfolio website by yourself, it's perfectly fine to include it in your projects list
- When including a project in your portfolio, you're not only showing off your skills, but you're also explaining the mindset behind the design. And this is something that potential employers are usually interested in.
- For frontend developers, explaining how you arrived at your chosen layout is just as important as having an aesthetically appealing design.
- You can go further and describe the steps you took to ensure your website followed the best developer practices: SEO and performance, accessibility, ...
- For beginners, I'd recommend using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript to build a portfolio, especially if it's the first time.

### Clone site

Being able to accurately convert a design to a fully functional webpage is a skill every frontend developer should have.

- You need to have a keen eye for layout and colours. You'll also need experienced-based knowledge such as knowing the best CSS display property to match a layout or being able to render an animation according to specification
- In most organisations, frontend developers are responsible for translating mockups and prototypes to webpages, so it's beneficial if your portfolio displays your 'design-to-code' skills. Building a clone website is a good way to do that.
- Clone Google homepage
- Look up designs on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/web-design) or [Behance](20design) and attempt to translate the design to code
- **Note**: all designs uploaded to these platforms are the copyrighted property of their owners, so you're not allowed to use them for commercial purposes

### CRUD web app

...e.g., blogs, e-commerce, dashboards

A basic form of a CRUD application is a To-Do List or a Notes webpage. Having one of these projects on your website shows your skill with manipulating data structures.

- Recommended technology: CRUD apps require use of reusable components so it's a good idea to build them using a framework such as React or Vue, depending on your familiarity.

### API com=nnected website

A lot of large scale projects require some sort of communication with a backend server and displaying data fetched from that server.

APIs allow frontend developers to collect, modify and delete data from a backend database. Building a site that consumes an API to display data is a great project to include on your portfolio.

> The competition for entry level is pretty high. So you have to differentiate yourself from the crowd

[How to Get Your First Dev Job – Insights from Reviewing Career Switchers' Résumés](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-your-first-dev-job/)

- Put in real content
- Inject it with your own personality. Find images that mean something to you.
- Take pride in your work: it doesn't need to be beautifully designed - I'm looking for an engineer, not a visual designer. But there's a basic level of care: do things overlap? Is there enough white space? Does it work on mobile as well as web?

**Building valuable skills and convincing others you possess those skills.**

Getting Your Mindset Right:

- make yourself stand out
- it's also important to note that most companies do not hire junior devs for their current skills, they hire them for their potential skills
- The most important thing you can do as an aspiring junior dev is show that you have the ability to learn, that you are eager and hungry to learn, and that you are capable of being taught and coached.

Building An Online Presence:

- GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Articles, your personal portfolio, ...
- Choose a high-quality headshot and use it across these platforms

Creating Valuable Things:

- Instead of building simple apps by following a tutorial or a course, build something completely unique that solves a real problem for you or someone else
- ...did that: then write about the process of finding that problem, discovering the solution, and building the solution

Connecting with People:

- Find companies and people you admire and connect with them on LinkedIn or Twitter, or even directly by email
- Try to send one of these every day to start building real relationships with people in the field
- Connect with other developers, potential employers, and recruiters on LinkedIn every day.
- Start engaging and commenting on their content, plus writing content of your own on what you are learning and insights you are having

[Becoming a Software Developer Without a CS Degree](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/career/no-cs-degree-required/)

- Starting your own business
- Internships: Because the first job is the hardest to land, an internship can provide a gentler on-ramp. In the ideal case, it can very quickly turn into a typical full-time dev role
- Transitioning from a different field: Many will take an underqualified candidate that they know is a good worker over a qualified candidate they haven't worked with before
- Referrals & Community Involvement
- Side Projects & Freelancing
- Personality & Skillset: Some of the folks in this category were able to get a job because they had exceptionally strong technical skills. Others had a diverse skillset that the employer appreciated. Others still were very persuasive, or excelled in the interview process
