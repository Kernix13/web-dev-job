## Resume Notes

What to include in your resume

### General

Some of these bullet points are good, some suck or are dated!

- Skills & acheivements at the top of the resume then chromo timeline below that for experience
- Reverse engineer your resume from the job posting
- Beat ATS: 1. tailor the resume to the job desc, 2. match your resume keywords to the job desc,
- A tailored resume says, “Here is an easy-to-read roadmap of where I acquired and developed each of your required skills and qualifications.”
- “Does my resume clearly state that I can do this?”
- “How quickly can I point to this skill from the description in my resume?” Test yourself.
- “Am I using the same language found in the job description?”
- Mirroring the language, keywords, and buzzwords found on the job description is the easiest way to prove you're a better match. Start with the job title
- Pay special attention to the skills mentioned first or _multiple times_
- Start each new job entry in your work experience section with skills and qualifications that are found in the job description
- A generic resume is about you while a tailored resume makes it about them
- Using bullet points instead of big paragraphs on your resume will make your matching qualifications more skimmable
- Corporate recruiters prefer to see skills in context. If they see a skill on your resume, they need to understand how and why you used it
- Use accomplishments with dollar amounts, percentages, or other measurables to prove your effectiveness
- Tailoring is also about removing information that distracts from your top skills.

### Sections

1. Prior experience: change your experience section to your PROJECTS section if you are entry-level - include bitly links
2. Skills section: the skills section nees to tie into the job you are applying to - don't flood the skill section with everything you've learned - 10-15 skills pertinent to the job (I have 19: lose Figma, JSON, Postman, VS Code and change RWD to Responsive Web Design, add SASS/SCSS)
3. Summary section at the top: show enthusiasm and passion - His Summary (weak IMO):

> "From the moment I produced "Hello World" in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But software development has never been "just a job" for me, it's offered an engaing challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple "Hello World" has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by."

- 1st section, professional summary: 2-4 sentences, skills & expertise for the position
- 2nd: determine the 2-3 most important skills needed for the position then list measureable acheivements elatd to them – or have one main area for the acheivements
- next skills & professional expertise – maybe
- then jobs with more acheivements – wtf?
- filter: application tracking systems???

## Cover Letter Notes

Cover letter format: 2/3 of the page max, 3-4 paragraphs,

The 4 Sentence Cover Letter That Gets You The Job Interview – cl's, emails, applicant tracking systems

### General

**Purpose**: to let the company know what you ae applying for, but you still need to effectively introduce yourself – do these 3 things, be brief because they get many emails, they do not have the time for a lengthy intro or CL –

1. Dear...I'm writing to inquire about the opening for - one sentence, done –
2. 2nd P, I offer blah-blah-blah which makes me a strong candidate for this position. Sentence 2 P 2 – the top portion of the attached resume highlights my career profile and 3 significant accomplishments that are also in alignment with this position (intrigue, telling where to find the info) –
3. 3rd P – "I'd welcome the opportunity to speak with you if you feel I'd be a strong candidate for this or any other position in your organization" - be brief, tell them why, create intrigue

> That last one is great!

More points: mention a connection, if there is one, right away, grab them right away – 3 P's with 2-3 sentences max, 1st intro, 2nd skills that are a match, 3rd | if the job desc doesn't mention sending a CL, send a CL |

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### Structure

Have KEYWORDS in resume objective as well as CL

- name
- city, state | ph # | email
- receiver's name, title
- company name
- address or dear hiring mgr
- P1: intro who you are, the position interested in, where\how you found out, title - and hjob #, brief summary of qualifications
- P2: discuss qulifications & achievments, examples of measureable achievements, don't repeat resume,
- P3: closing that you are a good fit, include a CTA – a call or interview,
- Thanks for your consideraton - EXAMPLE:

> `P1` I'm writing to express my interest in the XYZ position you have open on your company website … I am [experience] and am confident that my experience and skill set would be a great match for the position

> `P2` I have a strong knowledge of xyz backed by experience I have gained in the last 12 years. In my previous position, ...blah, blah, blah examples

> `P4` Sincerely,

Currently, here is a generic cover letter that I have. Also, I have a image of my signature which I created with a Stylus which I add after `Sincerely`:

October 23, 2022

Dear [Hiring Manager],

I am very excited about your opening for a [job title]. I believe my experience in developing my [WordPress theme] and [building JavaScript projects] with [responsive designs] would help me excel in the position and in your company.

I have experience maintaining multiple personal websites since 2009 along with taking various online courses on [responsive web design] and [Vanilla JavaScript]. However, I have been running my own pet services business for the past 14 years. As the business owner, I maintained all aspects of my website (SEO, Google/Facebook ads) as well as hired employees.

Here are a few of the main areas where I feel my experience aligns with your needs:
    • Experienced using [Node.js] and installing popular [NPM] packages such as [React], [Parcel], [Webpack], [PostCSS], and [Autoprefixer].
    • Used [CSS] design methods to ensure my website and projects are responsive across all devices and screen sizes.
    • Current projects involve using [React], [Bootstrap], [Tailwind], [jQuery], and various [Web APIs] to add to my online portfolio.

I'd welcome the opportunity to speak with you if you feel I'd be a strong candidate for this or any other position in your organization. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

James F. Kernicky

I put the specifics in square brackets to indicate some of the words and areas to change based on the job posting. As a matter of fact, the sentences would change completely for different jobs.
