## Resume Notes

What to include in your resume

### General

- SKILLS & ACHEIVEMENTS\qualifications AT TOP OF RESUME then chromo timeline below that
- reverse engineer your resume from the job posting
- beat an ats: 1. tailor the resume to the job desc, 2. match your resume keywords to the job desc,
- A tailored resume says, “Here is an easy-to-read roadmap of where I acquired and developed each of your required skills and qualifications.”
- “Does my resume clearly state that I can do this?”
- “How quickly can I point to this skill from the description in my resume?” Test yourself.
- “Am I using the same language found in the job description?”
- Mirroring the language, keywords, and buzzwords found on the job description is the easiest way prove you’re a better match. Start with the job title
- Pay special attention to the skills mentioned first or multiple times
- Start each new job entry in your work experience section with skills and qualifications that are found in the job description
- A generic resume is about you while a tailored resume makes it about them
- Using bullet points instead of big paragraphs on your resume will make your matching qualifications more skimmable
- Corporate recruiters prefer to see skills in context. If they see a skill on your resume, they need to understand how and why you used it
- Use accomplishments with dollar amounts, percentages, or other measurables to prove your effectiveness
- Tailoring is also about removing information that distracts from your top skills.

### Sections

1. Prior experience: change your experience section to your PROJECTS section - include bitly links
2. Skills section: the skills section nees to tie into the job you are applying to - don't flood the skill section with everything you've learned - 10-15 skills pertinent to the job
3. Summary section at the top: show enthusiasm and passion - His Summary:

> "From the moment I produced "Hello World" in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But software development has never been "just a job" for me, it's offered an engaing challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple "Hello World" has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by."

## Cover Letter Notes

Cover letter format: 2/3 of the page max, 3 paragraphs,

The 4 Sentence Cover Letter That Gets You The Job Interview – cl’s, emails, applicant tracking systems

### General

**Purpose**: to let the copany know what you ae applying for, but you still need to effectively introduce yourself – do these 3 things, be brief b\c they get many emails, they do not have the time for a lengthy intro or CL –

1. dear...i’m writing to inquire about the opening for - one sentence, done –
2. 2nd P, I offer blah-blah-blah hich makes me a strong candidate for this position. Sentence 2 P 2 – the top portion of the attached resume highlights my career profile and 3 significant accomplishments that are also in alignment with this position (intrigue, telling where to find the info) –
3. 3rd P – "I'd welcome the opportunity to speak with you if you feel I’d be a strong candidate for this or any other position in your organization" - be brief, tell them why, create intrigue

more points: mention a connection, if there is one, right away, grab them right away – 3 P’s with 2-3 sentences max, 1st intro, 2nd skills that are a match, 3rd | if the job desc doesn’t mention sending a CL, send an CL |
