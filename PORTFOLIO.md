Portfolio Tips:

1. [How To Make Your Front-end Developer Portfolio Stand Out](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/how-to-make-your-front-end-developer-portfolio-stand-out/)

The ideal portfolio should include several items:

- Begin with a custom logo: I kept it simple with lowercase cursive initials
- Add a tagline to highlight specific information
- Polish your design: 1) Usability should be your primary concern, 2) implement a creative, attention-grabbing design that appeals to your intended audience
- Include relevant skills, education, and work history: List only the skills that are most relevant to the role you're applying for...education and include any certifications you've earned. You'll also want to list any relevant work experience. Even if it was a non-technical position, find a way to tie it into your new role and explain how your skills transfer
- **Add a downloadable resume**: CAN'T BELIEVE I DID NOT THINK OF THIS - remove footer link CONTACT and replace with RESUME - either have it as a link to a PDF or my web page resume that have links to my resume in PDF and DOCX formats.
- Add your bio in an "About" page: ...share any relevant information that doesn't quite fit elsewhere in your portfolio or resume. Share an anecdote about why you got into programming
- Include a photo: This builds trust and shows people you're a professional.
- Make your contact information easy to find
- Add social media accounts: add Twitter, remove CodePen and make the icons larger
- List your specialties and services: I created a website for my pet services business, converted it to WordPress a few years ago, then created 2 more personal WP sites
- Include testimonials and awards: Have none
- Include relevant projects

2. [Web Developer Portfolio Inspiration](https://codingcareerfastlane.com/first-web-development-portfolio-projects/)

There are five aspects of creating a junior web developer portfolio that we focus on in this article:

- **Finding good projects to include in a portfolio**: 1) Fixing a specific feature of an existing product, 2) Look for nonprofit and open source work
- **Telling the story behind the examples that you include in your portfolio**: 1) Reasons you built this personal project, 2) Problems the project solves, 3) Tradeoffs that you made while creating the project, 4) Who the project was made for and why they need it
- **Development examples you shouldn't add to your portfolio**: 1) Tutorials or standard bootcamp projects, 2) Work experiences that did not end well
- **Things to avoid when building your own web developer portfolio**: 1) Lack of context, 2) Overly complicated web design layouts, navigation, too many colors, and other distracting elements on each page of your website, 3) Having no way to get in touch with you
- **Creative design tips for a good web developer portfolio**: 1) Be consistent with the design, 2) Show attention to detail, 3) Ask a UX engineer or creative designer to review your portfolio

4. [How to Be Taken Seriously as a New Developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-credibility-as-a-new-developer/)

In order to establish our credibility we need to demonstrate that we have valuable skills, and we need to get the right people to see those skills.

You need to not only have excellent communication skills, great motivation, be a self-starter, and so on, but you need to effectively communicate that you have those qualities to potential employers.

There are three main components to doing this successfully:

1. Building
2. Writing
3. Connecting

_Build Projects With Your Tech Stack_

- The best way to show that you have the right technical skills is to build unique things that don't exist yet.

_Write About What You Build and Learn_

- Allows you to get clear on your ideas and processes.
- Writing things down forces you to get as clear and concise as possible in your thinking and your methods
- Shows you are able to communicate effectively when you start working as a professional dev
- Write from the perspective of a teacher
- Keep a running list of ideas
- Write about more than just technical things: write about other things that can relate back to development, write about why you love coding, what motivates you to do great work, how you decompress outside of work hours, ...

_Connect with People in the Tech Community_

- It's sometimes the most difficult to actually start implementing
- Great tools for this: LinkedIn and Twitter
- Build up a network of people so that you don't ever have to look for work. You can simply reach out to your network to find something that's a good fit
- The goal is to increase your visibility and make it known you are looking for work. This way people will notice you, come across the foundation you've built with your portfolio and writing, and you'll stand out
- Start by making a list of 10 companies you would love to work for
- Then find 2 or 3 people at each of those companies that have positions similar to what you would like to do
- Connect with them on LinkedIn and follow them on Twitter if you can
- Then simply send them a message following this template: 1) Short introduction, 2) Thing you admire about the company, 3) Simple, easy-to-answer question you have for them
- The goal here is not to hard-sell yourself for a job, it's to initiate a conversation and build a relationship
- Your goal should be to reach out to one new person like this every day.
