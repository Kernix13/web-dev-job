# Networking Notes

I like organic networking on Twitter, but the JOB_BOARDS.md file or the networking examples I did on LinkedIn.

[How to Get Your First Developer Job through Intelligent, Genuine Networking](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/networking-for-aspiring-developers/)

- You don't have to constantly pester people asking for stuff, attend awkward events, or initiate fake conversations.
- it's as simple as interacting with people on Twitter and sending some emails
- The thing to keep in mind is that networking is a long game. If you approach networking selfishly or with short-term goals in mind, it will not work
- If you approach networking as a way to make new friends, build real relationships, and add value where you can, it will create a snowball effect.
- Networking should be mutually beneficial to each person involved
- This, however, takes a long time. So you need to approach this genuinely and patiently

### How to Network Effectively

two main tools: Twitter and email - We'll focus on social media for our more generalized, long-term networking, and then dive into a specific tactic using email to make yourself stand out to potential employers

#### Long Term Networking with Twitter

The goal here is very simple: to increase your visibility. After you've constructed a good online presence, consisting of complete Twitter profiles, a complete and active GitHub profile, and a good portfolio site, you need to get people to actually see it.

- How do you do this? By liking and commenting on stuff, following people, and connecting with people
- if you talk to the people that actually succeed with it, they all treated it as just genuinely sharing their thoughts, what they were working on, posting thoughtful replies to Tweets when relevant, and just being a human being
- when you like or comment on someone's post, their network will see that
- the most effective way to network is by just being a genuine person
- This is real networking at its finest: simple, genuine, and something you can do every day
- Once you get started with this simple step, you'll gradually start learning how to effectively interact with people over time and naturally get better and better and building relationships and connections
- These steps assume you are already following a decent number of people in the developer community

A few general tips before we get into the specific steps:

- All of this needs to be genuine. No spammy, "Awesome job!" or "Nice!" replies. Only tweet if you have something of value to add to the conversation.
- If you are able to, getting to a conversation earlier is usually better
- Don't target accounts with too large of a following. If you are just getting started, accounts with less than 15,000 followers are a good goal to engage with and then you can scale up as you start to grow.
- Experiment with schedulers, but don't feel tied to them. I tried one for a while and found I was able to be more consistent when I tweeted thoughts or realizations as they occurred to me
- Try to set aside engagement time. It can be easy to get lost in Twitter, so try to set specific engagement time each day so you don't kill your productivity

The steps:

1. Reply to 5 tweets from people that you admire with relatively large followings
1. DM one person you admire thanking them for something and telling them why you like it
1. Try to tweet out 3-5 high-value tweets per day. High-value can mean something insightful, a specific method for doing something, an update on what you are working on (working in public is a fantastic networking strategy), or even simply an honest thought that you don't hear very often

> Be honest, be genuine, and start now

#### Twitter Hashtags

Twitter web-based hashtags without the hash for easy copy/paste (bold are my preferred ones):

- `tech` | `technology` | `startups` | `security` | `searchengineoptimization` | `SEO`
- `career` | `job` | `hiring` | `work` | **`entrylevel`** | **`entryleveljobs`**
- **`development`** | `web` | **`webdevelopment`** | `webdev` | **`webdeveloper`** | **`frontend`** | **`#FrontEndDeveloper`**
- `design` | `webdesign` | **`responsivewebdesign`**
- **`javascript`** | `html` | `html5` | `css3` | `TypeScript` | `scss` | `json` | `jquery`
- `bootstrap` | **`tailwindcss`** | `materialize`
- **`wordpress`** | `wordpresstheme` | `wordpressplugin` | `php` | `htaccess` | `apacheserver` | `HTTPS`
- `ReactJS` | `reactnative` | `angularjs` | `vuejs` | `app`
- `postcss` | `parceljs` | `NodeJS` | `gitrepository` | **`github`** | `npm` | `figma` | `API` | `postman` | `webpack` | `devtools`

There is most likely a hashtag for any language, library, frameworm, or NPM package that you haveexperience with, so just do a search for any you do not see above.

#### Short Term Networking with Cold Email

...a somewhat controversial method of networking...the primary goal is to make yourself stand out to land a job

Basically it comes down to these steps:

1. Finding a few, say 5-10, companies you really admire and want to work for
1. Finding the best contact person at the company
1. Finding their email address (Twitter DMs and LinkedIn messages could also work if you can't find an email)
1. Figure out something small of value you could contribute and build a small mini-project custom for them that demonstrates that thing of value
1. Send in a video pitch introducing yourself, talking about why you love that company in particular, and talking about why you would be a great addition to the team

There are three critical components of this that make it so effective:

1. Showing you are capable of thinking outside the box and taking initiative despite perceived roadblocks
1. Showing your skills by building something real, instead of just talking about your skills like you would on a résumé or job application
1. Facilitating human connection by recording a short, personalized video of yourself

...choosing to take the initiative to build something like that on your own is a great use of your time...When you are recording your pitch video (?)...keep it short, around 2 minutes, smile, breath, and write some bullet points

...create a custom page on your portfolio site dedicated to the company. Then you can put your custom project on there, embed your video, and send out a simple cold email to the right contact person

They have an example text script to use

[The tactical networking guide for introverts](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-tactical-networking-guide-for-introverts-aadd93b09849/)

Learn how to find anybody’s email address:

- Don’t forget to first check if they listed their email publicly on their LinkedIn or personal site.
- You can also try guessing their work email in addition to their personal email.
- Personal gmail addresses are often the same as Twitter, GitHub, or LinkedIn IDs, especially if they use the same ID across multiple social media sites

### Send an email

There are three steps in the cold email funnel: finding an email address, getting the cold email opened, and getting a reply to your cold email.

- Your subject is the most important variable to influence open rates
- Try short, non-committal subjects, e.g. `Quick question`
- The email body: do everything in your power to make your email body not only easy to read, but compelling enough to warrant a reply
- Keep the email short. Aim to keep it less than 300 words
- People won’t remember your style, but they’ll notice your brevity and will reward you for it by actually reading your email
- Have an explicit call to action: Make sure your call to action sticks out
- Include a brief background about yourself. Just 1–2 sentences
- Don’t ask more than 3 questions
- Use bullet points and numbered lists

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### The reply to the reply

- If you have more questions to ask, this is the right time to ask them. You’ve built enough of a relationship, so ask another 3–5 more questions
- If you still have more questions, save them for the next email
- Don’t forget to thank them for their time
- Offer to return the favor. “Please let me know if I can return the favor. I’d be happy to do so!”

#### Following up

- Following up is how you solidify relationships and turn strangers into friends:

> “Hi there, I just wanted to close the loop with you on this. I followed your advice on XYZ, and it led to ABC. Thank you! I couldn’t have done it without you.”
