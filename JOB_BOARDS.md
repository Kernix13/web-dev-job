## LinkedIn

LinkedIn right now (October 2022) have the most and best job listing for web related jobs. And you have the ability to filter by the keyword `remote` which is what I prefer.

**Resumes and Cover letters**: You can upload your resume as with most sites and save any good matches until you write your cover letter. You can use the resume you uploaded or upload a resume specific for the job.

### Profile

You absolutely MUST optimize your profile. One of the best videos on how to do that is by Danny Thompson: [HOW TO USE LINKEDIN AS A DEVELOPER to get a job in tech! How to network!](https://youtu.be/SG5Sb5WTV_g)

### Write LinkedIn Articles

If you do not have your own website with a blog/article section, then writing full length articles (not posts) is an excellent option.

### Jobs

Definitely create some Job Alerts based on the job titles and features that you would like in a job. You also have the option to save jobs that you like and go back later to apply, but then most job boards have that feature.

Other links under the Jobs link are `Skill assessments`, `Interview prep`, `Resume Builder`, ...

### Skill assessments

They have Skill assessments/Tests on vaarious skills listed in your resume, but they are only about 15 questions long. But taking them and passing them does help get alerts on job postings that match your skills. Otherwise, I don't think passing them will influence hiring managers or recruiters.

### Networking

You need to find people you know or went to school with and connect to them. I made the following script to message other devs:

> Hello [name]. I'm a self-taught front-end developer & am updating my resume after completing my final project. I'm hoping to connect with other developers in the hope of getting job leads. I [...other details you have in common...].

I found this post:

> How was it possible, this seasoned developer didn’t understand even the most basic JS concepts like:

```I
- array iteration methods (𝘮𝘢𝘱, 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘵𝘦𝘳, 𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘦)
- the difference between const and let
- async/await pattern
- aware of OOP concepts
- Differences between composition and inheritance, interfaces, differences of class and object
```

I made some connections but nothing came of it. Then I searched for people in my area that also went to Drexel University. I have not contacted them yet, but here is the script I plan on using:

> Hello, [name]. I also graduated from Drexel with an Operations Management degree, but I am now trying to change carees and am looking for my first Front-End DEvelopment job. I noticed you are in that field so I wantd to contact you to see if you know of any companies that are open to hiring a self-taught developer. Or at the very least, to have you keep me in mind if you know of any job openings or can connect me with other developers.

> I built my own WordPress theme with the hope get getting some freelance web design work, but freelancing seems to be difficult. I have also taken a number of free and paid courses online on Web Design and Javascript. I recently completed my portfolio and would love to get any kind of feedback fro you on the design and the projects I have listed: https://kernixwebdesign.com/resume-portfolio.html

> Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you if you have any insights or prospects that would help me in my job search!

## FlexJobs

**Link**: [FlexJobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/)

**Free or Premium**: Premium, I paid for an annual membership which is around $60 USD.

**Resumes and Cover letters**: You can upload your resume as with most sites and save any good matches until you write your cover letter. You can use the resume you uploaded or upload a resume specific for the job.

The number of positions have seriously dropped in number for the web related positions I have search queries for. They also have some "tests" that you can take. They are longer than the LinkedIn tests, but I doubt they will influence hiring managers either.

## Dice

**Link**: [Dice](https://www.dice.com/)

**Free or Paid**: Free

**Resumes and Cover letters**: You can upload your resume as with most sites and save any good matches until you write your cover letter. You can use the resume you uploaded or upload a resume specific for the job.

This is a good site for tech jobs but with limited search parameters to limit the number of results.

## Ziprecruiter

It's difficult to create a quality search, but the single-click apply is nice.

**Resumes and Cover letters**: You can upload your resume as with most sites and save any good matches until you write your cover letter. You can use the resume you uploaded or upload a resume specific for the job.
