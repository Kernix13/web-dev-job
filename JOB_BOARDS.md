I made the following script to message other devs:

> Hello [name]. I'm a self-taught front-end developer & am updating my resume after completing my final project. I'm hoping to connect with other developers in the hope of getting job leads. I was in Philly but I am living in Delco now.

Found this post:

> How was it possible, this seasoned developer didn’t understand even the most basic JS concepts like:

- array iteration methods (𝘮𝘢𝘱, 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘵𝘦𝘳, 𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘦)
- the difference between const and let
- async/await pattern
- aware of OOP concepts
- Differences between composition and inheritance, interfaces, differences of class and object

## Flexjobs

The number of positions have seriously dropped in number.

## Dice

Some good openings on this site.

## Ziprecruiter

Difficult to create a quality search, but the single-click apply is nice.
